			  Obstacle course racing has been a big part of my life beginning in 2013 
			  when I convinced a coworker to run the Spartan Beast with me. It was the
			  worst experience of my life, and during the race I swore I would 
			  absolutely never do one again! But by the car ride home I was planning
			  everything I could to make the next one better, I was officially hooked.
			  In our day to day lives we often do not complete anything that is extremely
			  taxing on our bodies and minds. I believe this leads us to an apathic 
			  lifestyle, one where nothing is ever really quite wrong or exactly right.
			  We don't have the confidence to be successful in our endeavors because
			  we have no idea of what we're actually capable of, and how far we can 
			  push ourselves to get there. Obstacle course racing provides this for us. 
			  We train our bodies in preparation to perform to the best of our capabilities,
			  and get a chance to realize how strong we really can be. I am a former 
			  Spartan SGX coach, an ISSA certified fitness trainer, and have completed
			  over 68 races in my career.
