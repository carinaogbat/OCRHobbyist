This is my final project from SRJC's Web Development 1 class, focusing on design of a simple website using only HTML and CSS. I chose to base the project around one of my favorite hobbies, obstacle course racing. The website includes styling of a blog, a table, and a user input form as well as navigation and footers. There is a gallery included with thumbnail images linking to larger views of each image. All images have been optimized for web using the Adobe PhotoShop Elements editor. I have included my own YouTube video that I embedded, as well as the instructor provided video, allowing me to demonstrate use of the <video> tag.
